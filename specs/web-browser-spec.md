# Web Browser - Technical Specification

## Project Overview

Web is a next-generation macOS browser built with SwiftUI that delivers an unparalleled minimal, progressive UX experience rivaling Arc Browser. This native application emphasizes subtle design, smooth animations, and innovative interface paradigms that make browsing feel effortless and delightful.

OG prompt for reference of the ethos of this app: ("This new macOS app. Ensure you put in the intro that it is a next-gen UX macOS swiftUI native app, that grea design is minimal, small, subtle and progressive, that rivals Arc Browser. Should use native webkit integration, swiftui, should be forversion 14+ of macos so it uses the almost latest stuff. For features it needs to have: 1. All the basics of a browser like the inspect, history, cmd + t for new tab, download manager and all the shit necessary, and al the basics, dont forget any please. Please list them all in the spec t implement. 2. Custom title bar that dissapears like the arc browser, i should have a custom glass main window with a super slightly padding,then with cmd + s you toggle between sidebar or top bar for the tabs, in sidebar mode we should only show the favicons not the tabs names so it would be a super mega minimal sidebar, this would disrupt the industry people would love it, also since that sidebar would be so small the window controls like close, minimize, expand should like appear only o hover or something next-gen. 3. We need a cmd to toggle the tabs (sidebar or top bar) on/off into a windowless/borderless edge-to-edge mode, so only the website is visible. 4. Let's have a nic performant UI, minimal but nice looking, glass, it should have but smoot animations, the name of the app is "Web", lets add to create an svgsquared logo and use that one everywhere, for now could just be a "W". 5 Lets create a minimal "new tab" experience, a custom input bar thatsearches google but looks super nice. 6. Lets have a settings with all the basics. 7. I don't know if its easy to implement but would be nice t have an integrated native ad blocker like safari does, to have autofil like safari does and save passwords and stuff, automatic updates, also that stuff where you connect your google profile and it auto logins on all google places idk if thats possible locally and natively in the app, and restore all previously closed tabs/windows. 8. We also need incognit mode ofc, its a basic, clear all cookies and cache after closing., cmd + shift + t to reopen last closed tab too. 9. Customize toolbar. 10. hovering links a status bar should appear from the bot to show where the link shows, think of other next-gen ways we ca use this dynamic status bar for, super contextual ideas that would mak users go whoa. 11. Find in page, inspect, developer tools. 12. Background tab previews. 13. Adaptive Glass UI – Window background subtly adapts its glass tint based on website color scheme or favicon color. Favicon-based tab coloring – Sidebar favicon background gets a minimal color splash for faster recognition. 14. Floating micro-controls – Contextual floating buttons (e.g., back/forward) that appear on slight mouse movement.. 15. Background tab previews – Hovering over a favicon in sidebar shows a live preview thumbnail. 16. Subtle animated underline for loading states instead of spinners, next gen and super minimal gradienty and glowy. 17. GPU-accelerated smooth scrolling – Feel like iOS Safari, ultra-smooth with physics-based gestures. 18. Live content preview – Hovering over a link briefly shows a card preview of the page (cached snapshot). 19. Smart integration with Apple Universal Clipboard for seamless cross-device pasting. 20. Lets add some quick notes, in the new tab we have a quick notes section where users can write text or md like notion and we store it as a file in the hidden files where we store shit locally. 21. If easy have translation like safari does.... You can research Zen Browser, which is opensource, its c++ and javascript but maybe there is stuff to learn from it.

- **Animation FPS:** Consistent 120fps

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for models and services
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Performance profiling with Instruments
- Memory leak detection
- Accessibility audit
- Cross-version compatibility

## 🚨 CRITICAL BUILD REQUIREMENT

**CRITICAL: lets strive for 0 logs console, bug have logs of errors logs EVERYWHERE, so we can properly debug bc we have error checks at every step but the ideal is 0 logs, we only see logs if there are errors**

**ALSO CRITICAL: Don't take shortcuts to make stuff work, make stuff work PROPERLY.**

**ALSO EVERY SESSION MUST END WITH ZERO WARNINGS AND ZERO ERRORS**

After completing each implementation session, you MUST:
1. Run `xcodebuild -project Web.xcodeproj -scheme Web build` 
2. Verify the build completes with **0 warnings** and **0 errors**
3. Fix any warnings or errors before proceeding to the next session
4. Test the app runs without crashes
5. Mark the session as complete only after achieving zero warnings/errors

**Why this is critical:**
- Warnings accumulate and become unmanageable
- They hide real issues and potential crashes
- Clean builds ensure production-ready code
- Prevents runtime crashes like Double→Int conversion overflow
- Maintains code quality throughout development

**Non-negotiable rule: Never proceed to the next phase with build warnings!**

## Discovered During Work

### Tab Loading Continuity Fix (July 21, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Tabs that are switched away from before completing loading would never finish loading
- **Root Cause**: Aggressive hibernation system in Tab.swift:74 was destroying WebViews (`webView = nil`) when tabs became inactive, permanently interrupting any in-progress loading
- **Technical Details**:
  - Original hibernation guard: `guard !isActive && !isHibernated else { return }`
  - Missing protection for loading state meant WebViews could be destroyed mid-load
  - Hibernation timer logic didn't account for loading state when firing
- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. **Loading State Protection**: Updated hibernation guard to `guard !isActive && !isHibernated && !isLoading else { return }` in Tab.swift:74
  2. **Enhanced Timer Logic**: Modified hibernation timer to check loading state: `if !(self?.isActive ?? true) && !(self?.isLoading ?? false)` in Tab.swift:122
  3. **Loading State Monitoring**: Added `onLoadingStateChanged()` method to restart hibernation timer when loading completes
  4. **WebView Integration**: Updated WebView.swift navigation delegates (lines 174, 194, 225, 230) to notify tabs when loading state changes
- **Behavior Change**: 
  - Tabs now remain active in memory while loading, regardless of whether they're the active tab
  - Once loading completes, inactive tabs can be hibernated normally after the 5-minute threshold
  - Loading state is preserved when switching between tabs during page load
- **Verification**: Build completes with 0 warnings and 0 errors, tab loading now continues when switching tabs
- **Status**: Tab loading continuity issue fully resolved

### Google Homepage User Agent Fix (July 21, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Google homepage appearing uncentered with old design due to unrecognized user agent
- **Root Cause**: User agent string was set to only `"Web/1.0"` in WebView.swift:73, causing Google to serve legacy mobile/unknown browser interface
- **Fix Applied**: Updated user agent to `"Web/1.0 Safari/605.1.15"` to ensure proper Safari identification
- **Technical Details**: 
  - WKWebView needs proper Safari user agent string to receive modern Google homepage
  - Current Safari 2025 user agent format: `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 15_5) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/18.4 Safari/605.1.15`
  - Google detects browser capabilities through user agent parsing for optimal experience
- **Verification**: Build completes with 0 warnings and 0 errors, Google now displays modern centered interface
- **Status**: Google homepage appearance issue fully resolved

### Phase 2 Next-Gen UI Implementation (July 20, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Revolutionary Features Implemented**:
  1. **Custom Glass Window System**: Complete implementation with hover-reveal window controls and adaptive tinting
  2. **Favicon-Only Minimal Sidebar**: Industry-disrupting 60px sidebar showing only favicons, revolutionizing tab management
  3. **Tab Display Toggle (Cmd+S)**: Seamless switching between sidebar and top bar modes
  4. **Edge-to-Edge Mode (Cmd+Shift+B)**: Complete chrome hiding with macOS 18 Finder-inspired hover-reveal controls
  5. **Bottom Hover Search**: Seamless new tab input that slides up from bottom edge, never overlaying content
  6. **Adaptive Glass Effects**: Dynamic favicon color extraction for subtle UI tinting
- **Technical Achievements**:
  - Zero warnings, zero errors build quality maintained
  - Complex SwiftUI view hierarchies with smooth animations
  - Custom NSWindow integration with glass effects
  - Advanced hover tracking and gesture recognition
  - macOS 18-inspired UX patterns successfully implemented
- **Verification**: All keyboard shortcuts working (Cmd+S, Cmd+Shift+B), smooth animations, glass effects, hover reveals
- **Status**: Phase 2 revolutionary UI features fully implemented and production-ready

## Discovered During Work (Previous)

### WebKit Logging Suppression (July 20, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Verbose WebKit system logs flooding console with RBSService, ViewBridge, and ProcessAssertion messages
- **Root Cause**: Default WebKit configuration outputs debugging information that's not useful for app development
- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. **Environment Variables**: Set `WEBKIT_DISABLE_VERBOSE_LOGGING`, `WEBKIT_SUPPRESS_PROCESS_LOGS`, and `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE=disable`
  2. **WebKit Preferences**: Disabled `logsPageMessagesToSystemConsoleEnabled` and `diagnosticLoggingEnabled` in WebView.swift:36-37
  3. **App-Level Logging**: Added structured logging with Logger for actual app events in WebApp.swift:29
  4. **Clean Console**: Significantly reduced log noise while keeping error logs for debugging
- **Verification**: Build completes with 0 warnings and 0 errors, console now shows minimal relevant logs

### Google Search Functionality Fix (July 20, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Google search wasn't working properly for non-URL inputs in the address bar
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent URL validation logic between URLBar.swift and BrowserView.swift components
- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. **Enhanced URL Validation**: Improved `isValidURL()` function to better distinguish between URLs and search queries
  2. **Decimal Number Handling**: Added logic to prevent decimal numbers (like "1.5") from being treated as domains
  3. **Consistent Logic**: Standardized URL processing between URLBar and BrowserView components
  4. **Search Query Encoding**: Proper URL encoding for Google search queries with special characters
- **Verification**: Build completes with 0 warnings and 0 errors, Google search now works for any non-URL input

### Phase 1 Critical Fixes Applied
**Double→Int Conversion Crash (July 20, 2025)** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Runtime crash with "Double value cannot be converted to Int because the result would be greater than Int.max"
- **Root Cause**: Multiple unsafe operations including invalid WebGL preference keys and unsafe arithmetic operations
- **Comprehensive Fixes Applied**:
  1. **WebGL Configuration Fix**: Removed invalid `webgl2Enabled` and `webglEnabled` keys from WKPreferences that were causing NSUnknownKeyException crashes
  2. **Safe Conversion Utility**: Created `SafeNumericConversions.swift` with robust utility functions for all numeric conversions
  3. **Enhanced Progress Tracking**: Replaced manual safety checks with `SafeNumericConversions.safeProgress()` in WebView.swift:81 and BrowserView.swift:208
  4. **Safe Snapshot Creation**: Added comprehensive bounds validation using `SafeNumericConversions.validateSafeRect()` in Tab.swift:104-110
  5. **Download Safety**: Enhanced speed calculations with finite value checks in DownloadManager.swift:165-171
  6. **WebView Frame Safety**: Initialized WebView with safe non-zero frame (100x100) to prevent frame calculation issues
  7. **Comprehensive Validation**: Added utility functions for CGRect, CGSize, and numeric range validation
- **New Safety Infrastructure**:
  - `safeDoubleToInt()`: Clamps Double values to Int.min/Int.max range
  - `safeProgress()`: Validates and clamps progress values to 0.0-1.0
  - `validateSafeRect()`: Ensures CGRect has finite, safe dimensions
  - `validateSafeSize()`: Validates CGSize dimensions
- **Verification**: Build completes with 0 warnings and 0 errors, comprehensive crash prevention implemented

**Build Quality Enforcement**
- Established **zero warnings/errors** requirement for all sessions
- All Swift warnings eliminated from codebase
- Build process now clean and production-ready

### Hide Top Bar Feature Implementation (July 21, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **User Request**: Allow users to hide the top bar containing URL and navigation controls while maintaining hover search functionality
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: **⇧⌘ H** (Cmd+Shift+H) for toggling top bar visibility
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Added `isTopBarHidden` state variable to TabDisplayView and WebContentArea
  - Modified top bar display logic to check both edge-to-edge mode AND explicit hiding state
  - Enhanced bottom hover search to appear when top bar is hidden (not just in full edge-to-edge mode)
  - Updated hover zones to include bottom edge detection when top bar is hidden
  - Added notification handling for `hideTopBar` action
- **User Experience**:
  - When top bar is hidden via ⇧⌘ H, the URL bar and navigation controls disappear
  - Hovering at the bottom edge reveals the search bar just like in borderless mode
  - Different from edge-to-edge mode: sidebars can still be visible while top bar is hidden
  - Smooth animations maintain the glass morphism aesthetic
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing edge-to-edge mode and tab display modes
- **Build Status**: ✅ **Zero warnings, zero errors** - Production ready
- **Status**: Hide top bar feature fully implemented and integrated
