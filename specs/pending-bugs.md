# PENDING TASKS and BUGS

[ ] Missing 'Find in page' feature
[ ] In the AI responses, before responding the 3 dots are duplicated, not animated properly, and badly layouted. Also after the AI responses the message flickers in a loop forever, and we still see one of the 3 dots moving up and down
[ ] URL bar not working well, its not updating the url sometimes after clicking a link and stuff, shows the previous page url, should always show the current page, its critical that this is correct
[ ] Overlay panels like history, settings, etc show a weird square with blue accent border wrapping them
[ ] If there is no internet connection the page gets reloaded in a loop forever, we need a page for internet connection missing.

[ ] Show favicon in history panel, autofill, bookmarks panel
[ ] Open in new tab or cmd + link click should selected the new tab automatically
[ ] Does full screen videos work?
[ ] Double clicking window should expand the window to the whole screen and double clicking again should restore the previous size of the window
[ ] The keyboard gets "locked" for some specific reason, cant select inputs from the browser app or even from pages like the google input, and like pressing "spacebar" to stop a video is also locked and doesnt work
[ ] If user puts a wrong link like youtube.om it loops infinitely trying to load
