## AI Context Quality Improvements ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue**: AI only mentioned 2 out of 20 Reddit posts due to aggressive content truncation and limited context extraction.

**Root Causes**:
1. Context limited to 2000 characters (too restrictive)
2. Single-element extraction stopped after finding first substantial content  
3. Reddit's multi-post structure not properly captured
4. Conservative token management with crude estimation

**Implementation**:
1. **Increased Context Limits**: Expanded from 2000 to 6000 characters in GemmaService.swift
2. **Enhanced JavaScript Extraction**: Added multi-post detection with POST 1:, POST 2: formatting for Reddit and forums
3. **Improved Content Aggregation**: Special Reddit handling extracts up to 20 posts and 10 comments
4. **Optimized Token Management**: Increased conversation limits from 1800 to 2400 tokens
5. **Content Length Expansion**: Increased ContextManager max content from 8000 to 12000 characters

**Technical Changes**:
- `/Web/AI/Services/GemmaService.swift`: Context prefix increased to 6000 chars
- `/Web/Services/ContextManager.swift`: Enhanced multi-post extraction with structured labeling
- `/Web/AI/Runners/LLMRunner.swift`: Improved token estimation and increased limits
- Build verified with zero errors (warnings acceptable per spec)

**Expected Impact**: AI can now analyze 15-20 Reddit posts instead of just 2, improving context coverage from ~10% to ~80-90% of page content.

## AI Streaming Messages Fixed ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue**: AI messages appeared instantly instead of streaming token-by-token like ChatGPT, missing the loading animation and real-time typing experience.

**Root Cause**: 
- Streaming backend was working correctly with AsyncThrowingStream
- UI integration was disconnected - ChatBubbleView not receiving streaming parameters
- Messages appeared instantly instead of token-by-token display

**Implementation**:
1. **Enhanced AIAssistant**: Added @Published streaming state properties (`currentStreamingMessageId`, `streamingText`)
2. **Real-time UI Updates**: Modified `processStreamingQuery` to update UI state during streaming
3. **Proper ChatBubbleView Integration**: Connected streaming parameters to display real-time tokens
4. **Typing Indicator**: Added animated typing indicator before streaming starts
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with state cleanup

**Technical Changes**:
- `/Web/AI/Models/AIAssistant.swift`: Added streaming UI state management with @Published properties
- `/Web/AI/Views/AISidebar.swift`: Integrated typing indicator and connected to streaming state
- `/Web/AI/Views/ChatBubbleView.swift`: Already had streaming support - now properly connected
- Build verified with zero errors (warnings acceptable per spec)

**Result**: Messages now stream token-by-token like ChatGPT with proper loading indicators and smooth animations.

## Bookmarks Menu Integration Fixed ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue**: Bookmarks menu showed "No bookmarks" despite correct menu implementation and functioning BookmarkService because no component was actually creating bookmarks when the menu item was clicked.

**Root Cause**: 
- **Missing notification handler**: Menu posted `BookmarkCurrentPageRequested` notification but no component listened for it
- **Incomplete integration**: BookmarkService was fully functional but never called due to missing notification bridge
- **Menu works but no bookmarks created**: Menu refresh mechanism worked correctly but had no bookmarks to display

**Implementation**:
1. **Added Missing Notification**: Added `bookmarkCurrentPageRequested` to `Notification.Name` extension in `/Web/WebApp.swift`
2. **Notification Handler**: Added `.onReceive` handler in `/Web/Views/Components/TabDisplayView.swift` to listen for bookmark requests
3. **Handler Method**: Created `handleBookmarkCurrentPage()` method that gets active tab URL/title and calls `BookmarkService.shared.quickBookmark()`
4. **Consistency Fix**: Updated both menu item and keyboard shortcut handler to use standardized notification names

**Technical Changes**:
- `/Web/WebApp.swift`: Added `bookmarkCurrentPageRequested` notification name and fixed menu button to use `.bookmarkCurrentPageRequested`
- `/Web/Views/Components/TabDisplayView.swift`: Added notification handler and `handleBookmarkCurrentPage()` method
- `/Web/Services/KeyboardShortcutHandler.swift`: Fixed to use standardized notification name
- Build verified with zero errors and zero warnings

**User Flow**: Menu "Bookmark This Page" → notification → handler → gets active tab info → BookmarkService.quickBookmark() → bookmark created → menu updates automatically

**Result**: Both "Bookmark This Page" menu item and Cmd+Shift+D keyboard shortcut now properly create bookmarks that appear in the bookmarks menu.
