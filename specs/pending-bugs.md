# PENDING TASKS and BUGS

[ ] Missing 'Find in page' feature
[ ] In the AI responses, before responding the 3 dots are duplicated, not animated properly, and badly layouted. Also after the AI responses the message flickers in a loop forever, and we still see one of the 3 dots moving up and down
[ ] URL bar not working well, its not updating the url sometimes after clicking a link and stuff, shows the previous page url, should always show the current page, its critical that this is correct
[ ] Overlay panels like history, settings, etc show a weird square with blue accent border wrapping them
[ ] If there is no internet connection the page gets reloaded in a loop forever, we need a page for internet connection missing.
[ ] Let's ensure there are 0 warnings when building
[ ] Show favicon in history panel, autofill, bookmarks panel
[ ] Open in new tab or cmd + link click should selected the new tab automatically
[ ] If user puts a wrong link like youtube.om it loops infinitely trying to load
[ ] Missing way to clear the AI
[ ] When the top url bar is in hoverable mode the keyboard and focus of every input and similar gets on a "locked" state both the web pages and the app itself
[ ] The TLDR and the AI responses are missing markdown support
[ ] When having more than 1 window of this app the windows shadows flicker
