[ ] Change the AI sidebar icon from one star to many stars icon or similar
[ ] 'Page content available' should update on every page change, right now as you change pages it doesn't change

Fix all the pending tasks and bugs in the pending bugs spec. One by one, first research files and internet for refs, then spin up a subagent to implement a solution, check the task/bug as for review and then move to the next one, 1 by 1, do all of them.
